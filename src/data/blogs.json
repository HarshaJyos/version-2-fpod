Our machine uses a dual-action UV-C light and ozone disinfection process that penetrates every surface of the helmet interior, eliminating bacteria, fungi, viruses, and the volatile organic compounds responsible for odor — all without a single drop of water or harsh chemicals that could damage the EPS foam or padding. A complete sanitization cycle takes just 3 to 5 minutes, making it practical even for the busiest business environments. Whether you are an individual rider, a delivery company managing a fleet, or a bike rental service with dozens of helmets, FreshPod integrates seamlessly into your operational workflow."

When a microorganism — whether bacterium, fungus, or virus — is exposed to UV-C radiation, the photons are absorbed by its DNA and RNA molecules. This causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers: covalent bonds between adjacent thymine or cytosine bases that the cell's replication machinery cannot read past. The result is that the microorganism cannot reproduce, effectively rendering it non-infectious. At sufficient exposure doses (typically 10–40 mJ/cm²), UV-C achieves a 99.9% inactivation rate for common pathogens. FreshPod's carefully positioned UV-C arrays are calibrated to deliver this dose uniformly across the entire interior surface of the helmet cabin within minutes."

This is where ozone (O₃) becomes critical. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent: it reacts with the cell membranes and proteins of microorganisms, causing oxidative damage that destroys them. Crucially, ozone is a gas that diffuses into every crevice, fold, and air pocket within the helmet, reaching areas that UV light and any spray-based cleaning method simply cannot access. After the sanitization cycle completes, the ozone naturally breaks down back into regular oxygen within minutes, leaving no residue or harmful byproduct."

At the low ozone concentrations used in FreshPod's cycle (well below 1 ppm), exposure to polycarbonate visors, EPS foam, nylon straps, and synthetic padding materials for 3 to 5 minutes produces no measurable degradation. This has been validated through our material compatibility testing across the most common helmet construction materials used by Indian manufacturers. We also ensure that the ozone fully dissipates before the door can be opened, so there is zero user exposure to elevated ozone levels."

Moisture accelerates the degradation of EPS foam, promotes mold growth, and compromises the adhesives used to bond helmet components. Dry cleaning with a UV-ozone approach eliminates all pathogens without introducing any moisture or foreign chemicals, making it the only method that both sanitizes effectively and actively extends the operational life of the helmet."
